A small sample application in jMonkeyEngine3, demonstrating a chase cam with mouse look, physics, moving objects and animations.


For devs:

This project is used by the SDK as a sample application which is downloadable as a template, straight from github. It uses a tag as reference, so if any updates are made to this project, needs an update in the SDK as well to make sure it retrieves the latest version.

Any raw assets that may be required for development should be added to https://github.com/neph1/JaimesAscentAssets, to not increase the size of this repository, unnecessarily.
